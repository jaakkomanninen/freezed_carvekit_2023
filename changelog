Modifying this amazing starting point to fit my project needs.

Goals: create a more responsive experience, send webhooks from the process. At this stage I'm testing and experimenting. Once I have something that I think is useful, I will send an official request.

Other things on my todo: add automatic image placement/scaling/rotation fix.

2/16/23 Work in progress: add webhooks to give feedback on the progress as well as include Tumplate integration (create temp files for Tumplate users) as well as allowing authentication to Tumplate users.
